(Rebrawl classic patch 8/25 https://www.mediafire.com/file/k0bkac0789zy7c8/30_231_0820_-_Classic.zip/file)

(Rebrawl mods patch 8/25 https://www.mediafire.com/file/b36whcahbi75bxu/29_258_0820_-_Mods.zip/file) 

How to use ?
Place both the tool and the csv files in the same folder
(for the name it's prefered to start with an uppercase)
Run the tool and create an attack
Then create a super while using **the exact same name**
When you created attack and super you can create the brawler and keep **the exact same name**
After that you can check your csv file and verify if the row was correctly created
Now you just need to apply the changes using the parallel space method (normal apk changing won't work with the addtion of a brawler)
